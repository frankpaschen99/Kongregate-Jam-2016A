Adhere to these rules when creating new Tiled maps or they will not be  processed correctly:
1. The name of the tileset of every level MUST be named 'set_01'
2. In the map properties, the Tile Layer Format MUST be set to CSV and exported as a JSON file.
3. The .json file must be the levelName and nothing else
4. The tileset png must be titled levelName_tiles.png
5. All Tiled maps must have one Layer called Ground. (for now [5/28/16])
